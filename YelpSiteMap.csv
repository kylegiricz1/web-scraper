They have a good patio but also covered space. I like the benches, I like that I can smell the beans, and more than all of that I like their food and drinks. 

Haven't ever had anything bad here, sweat to the goddess. I'm also glad they have food options so the caffeine rush doesn't hurt my head haha. 

It's a great spot to hang out and read, hangout with friends, and enjoy an oasis away from the business of the CWE.","My friend and I had a nice visit to Northwest! The space is indoor/outdoor with plenty of seating. I loved all of the cute plants that bring so much life into the space! There was event a plant pop-up by forks & farms where you could purchase plants in the covered seating area. The ordering area is a bit cramped, especially when there's a line. 

I ordered an iced caramel latte and cinnamon bun. The latte was refreshing and delicious! The cinnamon bun was just okay and took a long time to get to me after I asked for it toasted. Everything else was great!","How have I never been here?? This coffee shop is such a vibe. I love all the outdoor patio seating and indoor seating. It's super spacious so you have room in there to chat or get work done. The service was amazing. I loved our barista. He helped us chose what to get and was so sweet. I ended up getting a mocha with coconut and it was the best drink I've had in STL.

One huge perk is they actually are open late! I can't find any coffee shops open past 1 or 2. Major points to them for that!","I don't think they had a lot of selections but it was enough room. Chilly in the winter time. I remember a overhang space heater. I think the transaction up front took a while. Or the service was a bit slower. I did enjoy the experience. I think company took my mind off of observing the shop."
